# Bundles


Changes the text to something else cursed. As of **v7 Pre-release 3**, RT970 once again contributed, making more cursed text. Stay tuned for more updates!


You can contribute by making your own changes in the bundle.properties file to help with the updating, but keep in mind:

- No NSFW text
- No replacing other people's changes
- Thats it

*If any of these rules are broken, your Pull Request will be closed following a message mentioning the rule broken also including a label saying "rule broken".*


Targets:

- A v7 release of bundles  - In progress...
- Bundles+  - Not started on yet...
- Progress to v7  - Around halfway...
