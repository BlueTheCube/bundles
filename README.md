# Bundles


Changes the text to something else cursed. As of **v7 Pre-release 2**, more *UI text* has been changed. Watch out for more updates!


You can contribute by making your own changes in the bundle.properties file to help with the updating, but keep in mind:

- No NSFW text
- No replacing other people's changes
- Thats it

*If any of these rules are broken, your Pull Request will be closed following a message mentioning the rule broken also including a label saying "rule broken".*
